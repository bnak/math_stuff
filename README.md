Algorithms as presented in various math classes coded in Python 


##Euclidean Algorithm

[Euclidean Algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm)


Function uses principles of the Euclidean Algorithm to recursively finds the GCD between two numbers.

Additionally, there is a proposition that states the following: 
The least common multiple of a and b is the product divided by the greatest common divisor; further, the least common multiple of a and b divides every common multiple of a and b.
This means that finding the LCM of a,b can be quickly found with the GCD - the LCM function is also included.
